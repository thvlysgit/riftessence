## Key Patterns

- **IDs**: All `cuid()` primary keys
- **Timestamps**: `createdAt @default(now())`, `updatedAt @updatedAt`
- **Unique constraints**: `@@unique` on join tables and business rules (e.g., one rating per rater-receiver pair)
- **Scrim uniqueness**:
	- `ScrimProposal @@unique([postId, proposerTeamId])` prevents duplicate active proposer entries per post
	- `ScrimSeries proposalId @unique` enforces one lifecycle series per accepted proposal
	- `ScrimTeamReview @@unique([reviewerTeamId, targetTeamId])` enforces one directed pair review
- **Cascade deletes**: Post→User, LftPost→User, CoachingPost→User, DiscordFeedChannel→Community
- **Composite indexes**: `@@index([region, role, vcPreference, createdAt])` for feed queries, `@@index([region, type, createdAt])` for coaching/LFT feeds
- **Rank validation**: CoachingPost OFFERING type requires coachRank ≥ EMERALD
